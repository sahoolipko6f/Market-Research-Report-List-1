<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Yachts Insurance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Actual Cash Value</li><li>Agreed Amount Value</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Yacht insurance markets typically operate under two main valuation types: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Agreed Amount Value (AAV). ACV calculates a yacht's worth by considering its replacement cost minus depreciation, which varies over time. In contrast, AAV establishes a preset value agreed upon by both the insurer and the owner at the policy's initiation, ensuring that in the event of a total loss, the owner receives the agreed amount without depreciation considerations.</p></p>
