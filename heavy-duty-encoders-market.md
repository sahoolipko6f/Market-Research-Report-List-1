<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Duty Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Encoder</li><li>Absolute Encoder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy duty encoders market consists of two primary types: incremental and absolute encoders. Incremental encoders provide feedback on the position of a shaft relative to a reference point, generating pulses as the shaft rotates. They are typically simpler and less costly. Absolute encoders, on the other hand, provide a unique positional value for each shaft position, ensuring precise location data independent of power loss. These encoders are essential in heavy-duty applications where accuracy and reliability are critical.</p></p>
