<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas scrubber market features three main types: open loop scrubbers, closed loop scrubbers, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers use seawater to neutralize sulfur oxides, discharging the treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers use a recirculating system with fresh water and alkaline substances, minimizing environmental discharge. Hybrid scrubbers can operate in both modes, adapting to regulatory requirements and environmental conditions. Each type serves to reduce harmful emissions from ships, promoting cleaner marine operations.</p></p>
